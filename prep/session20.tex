\subsection{Session 20 Prep}
Start: Ser 6, 5:00pm?

Facts decided in the previous sessions:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a member of BlueCorp, Shawn, who has been tracking shipping logs of the last six months, cross-referencing them with ships in the marina. He's been doing this for the past week, having made it almost through the ``S''s. His supervisor is Vaurice (he pronounces it ``Varus'', but it is actually like ``Maurice''). Klob instigated an altercation with him, and after calling the police he realizes that this could be good blackmail to hold over Klob's head in the future.\\
Additionally, Shawn works with Fekete.
\item As of 3pm, Shawn, Vaurice, and Fekete had the stones
\end{itemize}

State of the game:
\begin{itemize}
\item Norric is investigating near the Yam Lake Marina
\item Broderick, Klob, and Poncho just went to Yam Lake park, and are about to investigate some singed trees
\item Aleneth has been captured (his timeline is at about noon now)
\end{itemize}

What do I need to prepare for this session?
\begin{itemize}
\item Aleneth meeting with Sthera
\item How does the crew find Aleneth?

\item How does this chapter end?\\
There are two big threads to tie up:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Dissolution of BlueCorp
 \item Discovery of why Halcyon committed suicide
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Lower priorities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Norric wants to start learning how to pick locks
\item Norric wants to learn potionmaking
\item Who are the Five Fists bandit crew? (that killed San Juro's wife)
\end{itemize}
