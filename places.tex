\subsection{Cohdopia}
\label{nations:cohdopia}
Split into two nations, Allebahst and Babahl, in Naga 1002, 

\subsubsection{Allebahst}
\label{nations:allebahst}
\subsubsection{Cohdopian Normal School}
\label{places:cns}
Unlike the \linkto{places:arcaneinstitute}, the Cohdopian Normal School produces items in which magic is only a supporting element, if it exists at all. While neither school really produces weapons, an alumnus of CNS, Cole Grande, was the first to construct a gun some 75 years ago, which has been refined ever since to the variety of guns we have today. Further, while the Institute's magic is primarily of the \textit{evocation} and \textit{illusion} schools, the CNS largely specializes in \textit{transmutation} and \textit{abjuration}.
\subsubsection{Babahl}
\label{nations:babahl}
National symbol is a butterfly, called a ``H\=ato''.

\subsubsection{Arcane Institute}
\label{places:arcaneinstitute}
The gem of Ivy University and central to the Losokyan way of life, the Arcane Institute develops items that allow everyone to benefit from the conveniences of magic. Some of the Institute's most famous inventions include
\begin{itemize}
\item Sender blocks and the Red network, which allow for instantaneous communication for any two people within the network\\
The price of a sender block depends on its charge capacity and recharge rate, typically
\[ price = 3 * capacity + 2*recharge \]
The most common models are the (1,1d1) for 5gp, (5,1d4) for 20gp, (10,1d6) for 35gp, and (20,3d6) for 80 gp. 
\item Lights\\
These come in various sizes, intensities, and colors, although their price increases the further from ``baseball-sized 20' range white''. These also require \textit{serifs} from a magic font to run. Many buildings run a connection to the main font in the Institute, but portable fonts and font generators are also available.
\item Portable fonts, which are organized into how much \textit{serifs} they contain. In increasing volume, the primary sizes are ``Q'', ``V'', ``N'', and ``F''. 
\item Cameras, onamonapoetically called ``Shashin''; these print their pictures after a short delay (think polaroid)
\item \st{Action} Video cameras, however they can typically only record in greyscale and require \textit{serifs} to run.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dusky Bridge}
\label{places:duskybridge}


\subsubsection{Eagle Mountains}
\label{places:eaglemountains}
A mountain range opposite Losokyo on Yam Lake. Home to Hazakura Temple and Dusky Bridge, however it has been mostly abandoned since the ``murder'' of Dahlia Hawthorne, with one notable exception being the murder of Valerie Hawthorne. Because of this, while the road to Dusky Bridge is still followable, the area away from the temple is still fairly wild, with a base 20\% chance of encountering hostile wildlife during a given period of time. Beyond the temple, the mountains are much more untamed, with a base 40\% chance of encounter.  In such an instance, roll a d20 to determine what appears:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c}
Roll & Outskirts & Heart \\\hline
1 & Swarm of Poisonous Snakes  & Goblin party \\
2-5 & Dire wolves & Black Bears \\
6-10 & Black Bears & Giant Insects \\
11-15 & Giant insects & Swarm of Ravens \\
16-20 & Swarm of Bats  & Swarm of Insects \end{tabular}\end{center}

\subsubsection{Kurain Village}
\label{places:kurain}

\subsubsection{Losokyo}
\label{places:losokyo}
A large city on Gourd Lake that serves as a trade connection between the interior of Ylisse and the ocean and capital, \linkto{places:ylisstol}. 

\subsubsection{Monastery of Highsleaux}
\label{places:highsleaux}
Established by the \textit{conjunto} Wayreen shortly after the fall of \linkto{religion:grima}, the Monastery safeguards the knowledge of the Awakening rite and tracks the locations of the sacred Gemstones. Some thirty years ago, a monk tracking the location of Sable encountered Lide and her son, \linkto{people:tslil}. Recognizing the danger posed by the child, the monk worked with Lide to save her child from his fate, staging an Orc attack to buy her time to escape to Highsleaux. The monk, however, perished at Validar's hand during the fight.
