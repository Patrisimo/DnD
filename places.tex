\subsubsection{Eagle Mountains}
\label{places:eaglemountains}
A mountain range opposite Losokyo on Yam Lake. Home to Hazakura Temple and Dusky Bridge, however it has been mostly abandoned since the ``murder'' of Dahlia Hawthorne, with one notable exception being the murder of Valerie Hawthorne. Because of this, while the road to Dusky Bridge is still followable, the area away from the temple is still fairly wild, with a base 20\% chance of encountering hostile wildlife during a given period of time. Beyond the temple, the mountains are much more untamed, with a base 40\% chance of encounter.  In such an instance, roll a d20 to determine what appears:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c}
Roll & Outskirts & Heart \\\hline
1 & Swarm of Poisonous Snakes  & Goblin party \\
2-5 & Dire wolves & Black Bears \\
6-10 & Black Bears & Giant Insects \\
11-15 & Giant insects & Swarm of Ravens \\
16-20 & Swarm of Bats  & Swarm of Insects \end{tabular}\end{center}
