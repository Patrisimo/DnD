This vial contains enough ink for 10 pages of documents, 10 levels of spells, or 50 bills.

\subsection{Boots of Mysterious Stepping}
\label{items:boots}
A \textit{cursed} item that allows the wearer to cast \textit{Misty Step} once per short rest. When cast within 30 feet of a hostile creature, the boots instead teleport the wearer to immediately in front of the most dangerous creature in range.

\subsection{Emblem of Mini/Buckle of Wumbo}
\label{items:wumbo}
A magical item in the shape of a letter ``M'', made of basalt. Contains 1 charge each of \textit{reduce} and \textit{enlarge}, which are cast by holding the item so that it looks like an ``M'' for \textit{reduce}, and upside down (``W'') for \textit{enlarge}. Casting \textit{identify} on this artifact reveals only half of its properties, corresponding to the orientation of the object. Each charge has a 25\% chance of recharging each dawn.

\subsection{Falchion}
\label{items:falchion}
A greatsword that together with the \linkto{items:fireemblem} are the Ylissean royal treasures. Forged from one of  \linkto{religion:naga}'s fangs, the sword can be empowered through the \linkto{spells:awakening} ritual.

\subsection{Figurine of Wonderous Power (seagull)}
\label{items:peeko}
A statuette of a seagull, carved out of driftwood. Acts as a normal \textit{Figurine of Wonderous Power}, and when used allows the user to cast \textit{Animal Messenger} on it. The creature contained in the figurine is a \textit{fey} seagull, previously the familiar of a now-dead Sorceress that was bound to the figurine when it was passed to the widower (\linkto{people:mrbriney}). As such, the seagull, Peeko, is primarily interested in returning to Mr. Briney, however she will still follow the commands of the owner of the figurine.\\
\\
When used by Mr. Briney, the seagull may exist in physical form indefinitely.

\subsection{Honeycomb necklace}
\label{items:honeycomb}
A \textit{cursed} necklace with a small piece of honeycomb attached. When worn, gives wearer disadvantage on all checks involving items containing the letter ``B'', and if their armor contains the letter ``B'', attacks against them have advantage. 


\subsection{Lide's Earring}
\label{items:lideearring}
A \textit{magic} earring given to \linkto{people:tslil} that, through \textit{Disguise Self}, conceals his Mark of Grima on his right hand.

\subsection{Necklace of Grima}
\label{items:grimanecklace}
A \textit{magic} necklace with a pendant of the Mark of Grima. When worn, the bearer takes the form of a \textit{Tiefling} (and looks exactly like \linkto{people:validar}'s Tiefling form), as if under the effects of \textit{Alter Self}.

\subsection{Pizza Dog}
\label{items:pizzadog}
A \textit{magic} trinket with an engraving of a dog, about 4 inches long, with circular marks on it (pepperoni) and the engraving surrounded by a rounded border (crust).

\subsection{Shield of Seals}
\label{items:fireemblem}
A shield that together with the \linkto{items:falchion} are the Ylissean royal treasures. The shield has five insets for its Gemstones: Argent, Gules, Azure, Vert, and Sable; however, only Argent is currently present. Allows one with Exalted blood to perform the \linkto{spells:awakening} ritual, although the full complement of gemstones are required for maximum effect.

\subsection{Spade of Detection}
\label{items:detectspade}
A \textit{magic} broach made of purple jade and in the form of a Spade. When within five feet of a source of magic (other than itself or other \textit{detection} items), it lets off a faint glow.

\subsection{Thalassa's Bracelet}
\label{items:bracelet}
A magical bracelet made of a unique metal alloy that fits its bearer's wrist perfectly, and thus feels tight if the bearer is tense. Grants $+2$ to Insight and Perception checks on targets the bearer can see.\\
\\
If the bearer is a descendent of \linkto{people:thalassa}, this item alerts the bearer when someone in the field of view is actively lying or hiding something from you, and further grants advantage to Insight checks in this situation.

\subsection{Thinker Statue}
\label{items:thinker}
A stone statue of ``The Thinker''. It is secretly also a clock, which announces the time in \linkto{people:larry}'s voice as ``I think it's \{TIME\}'' when its head is turned. \\

A jade, comma-shaped bead that can store spiritual power. Casting \linkto{spells:empower} fills the Magatama with charges, after which it cannot be filled again for 1d3 weeks. While empowered, the Magatama glows with a faint green color, and if touching the skin of the person it is attuned to, will vibrate and expend a charge when someone within 5 feet is actively lying or hiding something from you.
