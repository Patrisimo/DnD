\section{Introduction}

Twenty-two years ago, in the year 63 Mostyn, the Exalt of \linkto{nations:ylisse} declared a crusade against \linkto{nations:plegia}, vowing to rid the continent of the Grimleal (followers of the dragon \linkto{religion:grima}), whom Ylissean religion deems to be evil agents of discord and destruction. However, Ylisse failed to progress very far into Plegian territory, and the war stood at a stalemate for twelve long years. It was at that point, ten years ago in 75 Mostyn, that the Exalt suddenly died and his daughter, \linkto{people:emmeryn}, took the throne. A compassionate ruler, Emmeryn quickly negotiated a white peace with Plegia's \linkto{people:gangrel} and focused her attention to healing the realm from the scars of war. Plegians remain skeptical of the new Exalt's compassion, and harbor deep hatred towards all Ylisseans in the wake of that war.

The \linkto{nations:ferox} to the north is a collection of kingdoms, divided in loyalty to the Eastern and Western Khanates, which are both sovereign under the Feroxi throne. In Ferox, strength is the most valued quality of all, and politics revolves around posturing oneself as stronger than the alternatives. Because of this, little attention is paid to the goings-on outside Feroxi borders, and thus Ferox is able to maintain warm relations with both Ylisse and Plegia. 

The starting date is 10 Emmeryn, Ket 21 (Pentek).

\subsection{Losokyo}

Losokyo, like any large city, has been plagued with thieves and pickpockets for time immemorial. However, soon after the Ylissean Crusade began to truly wear on the Halidom, about two years into the war, criminal elements began taking over large sections of the city. In response, the city took drastic measures to combat the crime problem and suspended the principle of ``innocent until proven guilty''. The local priestesses of \linkto{religion:themis}, the dragon of Justice, fearing their god's retribution, rapidly trained prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges in an attempt to ensure justice is carried out even under these dire circumstances.
% nd, due to the stress this caused the legal system, enacted a maximum time limit on court cases and
\begin{center}
``The end is only justified through proper means'' \\
- Inscription on the Central Courthouse
\end{center}

The priestesses maintained this practice for a couple years, until 68 Mostyn, when they left Losokyo to establish the Themis Legal Academy in a more central location of the Halidom, in order to train legal experts for use across the realm. However, with their departure, the people of Losokyo have gradually lost faith in this new legal system, particularly becoming wary of corrupt prosecutors fabricating evidence and police incompetence. Among several events, two in particular stand out as embarrassing failures of justice.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \linkto{events:dl6}\\
During this period of prosecutorial corruption, public faith in the law rested entirely on the defense attorneys. In 73 Mostyn, one of the most famous defense attorneys, \linkto{people:gregory}, took on master prosecutor \linkto{people:mvonkarma} in a high profile case. During a recess in the trial, Gregory was in a lift with his son, \linkto{people:miles}, and a court bailiff, \linkto{people:yogi}, when an earthquake struck, incapacitating the lift for a period of time. When the lift was repaired and opened, Gregory was found dead, shot by a gun.

The police were unable to make any progress on this case, and so secretly consulted \linkto{people:mistyfey}, a spirit medium and head of \linkto{places:kurain}. Misty channeled Gregory's spirit, who fingered Yogi as the culprit. The fact that the police consulted a spirit medium was leaked to the press, causing a scandal. Further, Yogi's attorney, \linkto{people:hammond}, succeeded on acquitting his client through pleading temporary insanity. 

\item \linkto{events:kidnapdh}\\
Not too long after the DL-6 incident, \linkto{people:fawles} kidnapped \linkto{people:dahlia}, the daughter of a wealthy jeweler, and demanded a \$250,000 GP diamond for her return, to be delivered to \linkto{places:duskybridge}. \linkto{people:valerie}, Dahlia's sister and a police officer, was chosen to conduct the random payment, however Fawles pushed Dahlia off the side of the bridge midway through. Dahlia fell into the dangerous current to almost certain death, and the gem was lost as well. For this, Fawles was sentenced to death, however as of Emmeryn 3, his sentence has not been carried out.
\end{enumerate}

Under the peace brought to the halidom by Exalt \linkto{people:emmeryn}, Losokyo has seen only a slight return to order. In recent months, police have been flummoxed by a series of murders that they have been unable to solve. Outside the city, bandits terrorize merchants, who are nearly defenseless after the Exalt's downsizing of the Ylissean army. Losokyan militas have scoured the countrysides in search of bandit camps, but have made little progress. Unbeknownst to the civillians, many of these bandits are actually Plegian raiding parties, directed by \linkto{people:gangrel} in attempts to re-ignite war between Ylisse and Plegia.

\subsection{Ylisse}
Recognizing the need for her halidom to heal after the trials of the Crusade, Exalt \linkto{people:emmeryn} has turned her attention to internal affairs. She all but disbanded the Ylissean army, allowing those soldiers to return to their villages, which had suffered from a lack of manpower to tend to farms and workshops. Instead, Ylisse's internal affairs are protected by the Shepherds, a royal guard led by Prince \linkto{people:chrom} that travels across the realm to protect against bandits and other threats. While effective when present, the Shepherds are unable to protect the entire halidom at once, and bandit attacks have only grown in frequency. This, however, is also largely due to Plegian raiding parties that disguise themselves as bandits to terrorize Ylissean towns. The Shepherds are aware of the true identity of these ``bandits'', however Emmeryn is adamant in avoiding another war.


\subsection{The World}
\subsubsection{Time}
Years in Ylisse are marked as years since the current Exalt's coronation, which always occurs on Ich 1 (although they have \textit{de facto} power as soon as their predecessor steps down), and starts counting at 1. For this reason, Ich 1 is also usually referred to using the current Exalt's name when not ambiguous; when referring to the current Exalt, it is typical to use their title. The starting year is thus Emmeryn 3, as Exalt Emmeryn took the throne three years ago. If the speaker wishes to emphasize historical continuity, they may use Naga years, counting the years since the first Awakening ritual. Emmeryn 3 corresponds to Naga 1012. Naga years are also used across cultures, although they are referred to as ``Grima years'' in Plegia, and in Cohdopia one would say ``1012 Naga''. Each year is broken into eleven months:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
1. Ich & 2. Ket & 3. Ser \\
4. Yaun\footnote{[\textipa{jon}]} & 5. Chine\footnote{[\textipa{tSAIn}]} & 6. Haut\footnote{[\textipa{hot}]} \\
7. Eb & 8. Neige\footnote{[\textipa{neZ}]} & 9. Kyu \\
10. Tiz & 11. Zaun\footnote{[\textipa{zon}]} \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Each month consists of four weeks, each thereof consisting of eight days, which are

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l}
1. Neiged\footnote{[\textipa{"ne.dZEd}]} & 2. Kedd & 3. Serda & 4. Chutork \\
5. Pentek & 6. Sombat & 7. Vasarnap & 8. Honapon \end{tabular}\end{center}

Days are divided into 24 hours, typically referred to in 12-hour format and disambiguated with AM/PM. Hours consist of 60 minutes, etc.
