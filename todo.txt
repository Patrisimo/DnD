What is Redd White's secret emblem? (Paradox insignia?)


Klob,

Tales have reaches Losokyo of an intrepid private investigator in Ferox who is looking to increase his reknown across the continent. I have a proposition for you: Here in Losokyo, there are dark forces conspiring to steer the city from the path of justice. Already they work behind the scenes, infiltrating the checks meant to keep them at bay. I ask you, as an esteemed detective untouched by this taint, to come to Losokyo and aid me in stopping them before it is too late. I have assembled a team of Ylisseans to help in this mission, please meet them, and me, at the southern gate of Losokyo at noon on Ket 21. Your lodging in the city will be provided.

Best,

Mia Fey
