Can use BW layered victory road music for suspenseful cavern, or for a neat end to a suspenseful arc where items they collect build up their ability to fight the final boss.

In Lucina's future, Grima is ressurected and all of the Shepherds are killed. Grima, however, is careful and slowly builds up his power, particularly given the weakened state of Plegia after the two successive wars. During this time, he sends a force to Cohdopia and seizes Tiki's dragonstone, forcing her to travel to Ylisstol to ask Lucina for help.
First oneshot:
Inigo, Brady, Yarne, and Owain are sent to Plegia in order to try and retrieve the dragonstone, while the other children stay behind to protect the capital. They track it down to a cavern dug into a a rocky hill, about 400' in diameter. However, the hill is crawling with Risen. Inside, various other undead crawl the halls, with the main room protected by a Beholder Zombie.

Other oneshot:
Some years later, Grima begins truly bearing down on Ylisse, and with Losokyo under seige, Lucina realizes they absolutely must find the gemstones in order to defeat Grima (they had been searching, but to no avail). Finally, with the help of (somebody), they realize the locations of the gemstones (and the Emblem? probably)
-The Shield is being kept in Thabes labyrinth; Lucina and friends go there, also pick up Argent (but are foiled if this is the true timeline) from someplace nearby
-Sable and Vert are (?)
-Azure and Gules are (?)

These probably make the most sense to be filler cases, especially in the afterbellum period. Before Lucina's identity is revealed, should have one episode involving her. Also do the Thabes mission right after the threat of Grima is revealed, but also give the characters a little info from the slabs.
