\subsubsection{Validar}
\label{people:validar}
A human illusionist and head of the Grimleal. Years of religious loyalty to Grima and practice of dark magic has twisted his form, and so he now permanently dons an illusion to look like a tiefling to mask his horrid figure. The source of this illusion is his holy symbol, a \linkto{items:grimanecklace}, which he always wears under his cloak.


\subsubsection{TSLIL}
\label{people:tslil}
A fellblood bearing the Mark of Grima on the back of their right hand. Son of \linkto{people:validar} and \linkto{people:mrstslil}, he bears both the proper Heart and Blood of Grima to be the Fell Dragon's vessel and aid in its ressurection. Unwilling to sacrifice her son for this purpose, MOTHER took TSLIL and fled to Ylisse, and paid for an illusion to hide his Mark.
