\subsubsection{Ket 21}

The party met up with Lana Skye just inside the city gates, who proceeded to show them to their accomodations. While entering the hotel room around 2pm, two of the party members (Broderick and San Juro) notice Larry Butz walking out of the hotel. In the room, Lana stood out on the balcony of their hotel room as the party settled down. After a short while, the party goes to the nearby Borscht Bowl Club for lunch, and then Thora asks to see the Police Station. Upon arrival, however, San is promptly arrested for murder. Lana, being only able to vouch for Thora, as she was on the balcony, steps aside, however the party manages to convince Detective Gumshoe to place San under house arrest. Thora, upset, returns to the Borscht Bowl Club and doesn't return. Through some investigation, the rest of the party manages to learn that the victim was Cindy Stone, who just returned from Babahl, and was killed with a small statue. However, with time running out and Mia nowhere in sight, Aleneth, Broderick, and Klob agree to defend San in court. About an hour later, Mia arrives with an autopsy report and tells the party to meet her at the courthouse by 9 AM.

The next morning, the party awakens and finds that the officers that were previously guarding the hotel had left. Seeing an opportunity, San Juro decides to try and escape by descending a rope from the balcony of their room, however Klob tries to stop him by pulling the rope up. San outpaces Klob and jumps to the ground, but fails the landing. Klob then descends the rope and tries to pounce onto San, but also fails; however he quickly charges and tackles San. Broderick eventually notices the scuffle and walks over, and San agrees to go to the courthouse. Upon arrival, the group discovers that the defendant was changed last night, and they had accidentally signed a form agreeing to be the assigned defense team, not the defense team for San Juro. The defendant is Larry Butz, an old friend of San's. In the courtroom, the group manages to poke holes in the witness, Frank Sahwit, testimony, and with some help from Mia manage to break him and uncover his guilt.

In celebration, Mia took the party to the Borscht Bowl Club, and explained that one of the current problems is a tenacious band of bandits that has been terrorizing the town. She tells them of a journalist who seems to have found evidence of their location, and directs the party to talk to her, as she is probably by Yam Lake. Sure enough, the party finds Lotta Hart mid-search for Pasquatch, and she gives them a picture she took up near the Eagle River cliffside of some wagon tracks leading straight to the edge of the cliff. Convinced, the party decides to investigate the area, immediately heading out of the city, stopping to buy a horse on the way out. They set up camp near the main intersection outside the South gate, and train the horse to not be afraid of battle sounds.

The party wakes up at the crack of dawn and continues towards the Mountains, having to cross a draw bridge over the Yam river. Deep in the forest, a pack of wolves attacks the party, but with the help of Norric, they manage to fight them off. Norric mentions that he's never seen the wolves so aggressive before. The road leads them to Dusky Bridge, which is heavily in disrepair, and an open area with some paths leading further up the mountain. They inspect the near cliffside, and notice an opening to a cavern. Tying a rope to a tree and letting the rope down the cliff-face, they succeed in entering the cavern, and sneak towards the Statue Room. While investigating, Norric uses a produced flame to closely inspect the orb in the center, which causes it to start glowing and a flame to appear on the Primidux and shield statues. After some more investigation, the party moves the statues into an order so that the message on the wall is reproduced in counterclockwise order, revealing a door underneath the message. Satisfied, the party decides to take a short rest before continuing through the door.
